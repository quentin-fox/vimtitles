1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
new subtitles 

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,833
here is the subtitle for this right now
and another line in the timestamp for good measure

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,283
here is the subtitle that I'm trying to type

4
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:16,316
writing new subtitles is a piece of pie!

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,183
here I'm opening the OSCR window using selenium

6
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:36,400
you can see when each site's participant data has been exported in the console

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,633
and when it's done, the terminal will return to the prompt

8
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:47,283
and the browser will close
